"""Read sampled frames without a seek per sample.

The scene classifiers sample a handful of frames per scene with
``cap.set(CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES, i); cap.read()``. On H.264 every such seek
decodes again from the previous keyframe, so a clip's ~100 samples decoded
the same GOPs over and over: 89 CPU-s for one 20 s clip, against 6 CPU-s for
a single forward pass that keeps the frames asked for (prod bench,
25-sep-2026). The frames are byte-identical either way (checked on 217
samples of NVENC-cut clips), so every downstream decision stays the same.
