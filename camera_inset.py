"""Find the webcam inset in a screen recording, and frame the two apart.

The case: one source, the whole screen (a game, a desktop, an editor) with the
person composited into a corner. It is how OBS records and how every stream VOD
looks, and it is the case screencast_layout gets wrong. There the speaker band
is a large crop taken AROUND the face, which on a full-screen source means the
band is mostly more screen: measured on an Excel walkthrough, the output showed
the same spreadsheet twice, once whole and once enlarged.

What this needs instead is the inset's own rectangle, so the two bands can hold
genuinely different things — screen above, person below.

Finding it exactly is harder than it looks. The inset is not always a rectangle
(circles and clipped polygons are common), it has no reliable border, and on
gameplay the background moves as much as the person does, which rules out
temporal-variance tricks. What IS reliable is that the inset is anchored to a
corner and that a person detector fires inside it. So: locate the person, decide
which corner they are nearest, and grow a box from that corner until it covers
them with margin.
